PLAB-2 (TDT-4113) Project 6: Behavior-Based Robot Control

## The demo
*BBCON in OO Python doing some interesting, multi-stage task.
*Use camera + at least 2 other sensors (Zumo button does not count). Each must be used in at least one of the stages.
*Robot does the task such that EACH of your behavior objects can be clearly seen to have some effect upon the robotâ€™s activity.

### Typical multi-stage task

1 Robot follows lines for awhile, while avoiding obstacles, then,
2 when it arrives at a goal location (e.g. a special spot on the floor, or a
wall),
3 turn on the camera and use it to find an object (e.g. a red ball), and
4 move toward that object.
